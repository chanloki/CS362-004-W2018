Bug 1:
smithy card found at cardtest1.c

This unit test is to test the the effect of smithy card action by testing the hand size, deck size, and number of coins. 

The bug is at line 679 in dominion.c file. It should allow the player to draw 3 cards; however, the code allow the player to draw 4 cards instead.


Bug 2:
adventurer card found at randomtestadventurer.c

This random testing generates different number of players, hand count, and deck count for the game, and to check whether the hand count and deck count are correct.

The bug is at line 666 in dominion.c file. I found that the hand count and deck count are different than what it is expected.
